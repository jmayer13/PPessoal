			<h3>INTJ</h3>
			<p>"When an INTJs gets excited about a topic of interest, they will absorb information on it with all the enthusiasm of a starving amoeba. ...</p>
			
<br /><p>
INTJs are intrigued by theories, ideas, and all kinds of abstract subjects with global interest. They are often found in cutting-edge, innovative fields where they can sharpen their keen minds upon complex intellectual challenges. They constantly accumulate information, incorporating it all into their mental framework of facts and ideas for future reference. They tend to focus on overarching principles rather than single examples.
</p><br /><p>
To an INTJ, life is a giant experiment where the goal is to continually improve everything around themâ€”projects, tools, relationships, theories, organizations. They seek to be competent in everything they do, and their ceaseless need for improvement means that good enough never is."
